                I’m a long-time crafter, book worm and computer enthusiast. I enjoy gaming, coding, reading and sewing. Being able to create or turn off my brain and immerse myself in a world helps recharge me.<br>
                I’ve been coding in one form or another since 2015, I think? But I’ve been gaming in general for about twenty years. I think the first game I designed was a MLP point and click game. It never went past scribbling ideas on paper with a pencil.

            Experience<br>
            <p>
                I have used Unity and Visual Studio extensively in my game development journey, and explored Java a bit in the past, but not as much as I would like to have done. I hope to change that in the next few years. I’ve used Unity much less in recent years, but Visual Studio has remained a mainstay in my personal coding projects, which includes a personal github pages website, and numerous Minecraft Datapacks and Resource Packs.
